# NLP Project: Analyzing Word Frequency in Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping the novel *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville from Project Gutenberg and performing a word frequency analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project showcases various steps including web scraping, text preprocessing, and visualization of word distributions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - `requests` for web scraping
  - `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for HTML parsing
  - `nltk` for natural language processing
  - `collections.Counter` for frequency analysis
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `wordcloud` for generating word clouds

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/capybaraavocado/moby-dick-nlp.git
   cd moby-dick-nlp
   ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
   ```

3. **Download necessary NLTK data:**
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

4. **Run the Python script:**
   ```bash
   python moby_dick_nlp.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `moby_dick_nlp.py`: The main Python script containing the entire NLP pipeline.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Importing Required Libraries

The project begins by importing all the necessary Python libraries, including `requests` for web scraping, `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML, `nltk` for NLP, and `Counter` for frequency analysis.

### 2. Web Scraping Moby Dick

Using the `requests` library, the HTML version of *Moby Dick* is fetched from Project Gutenberg. The HTML content is then extracted for further processing.

### 3. Text Extraction and Preprocessing

The HTML content is parsed using `BeautifulSoup` to extract the raw text of the novel. This text is then processed to remove non-alphabetic characters, and all words are converted to lowercase.

### 4. Tokenization and Stop Words Removal

The text is tokenized using NLTK's `RegexpTokenizer`, which splits the text into individual words. Common English stop words are removed to focus on the more meaningful words in the text.

### 5. Word Frequency Analysis

The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each word in the text. The top 10 most frequent words are identified and printed.

### 6. Visualization

The word frequency data is visualized using a bar chart and a word cloud, providing a clear and insightful view of the most common words in *Moby Dick*.

## Results

- **Most Common Words:** The most frequent words in *Moby Dick* were visualized using both a bar chart and a word cloud.
- **Key Insight:** The visualizations help to identify the recurring themes and keywords in the novel.
